# Frameshock Framework

**A robust, modular penetration testing framework designed for real-world security assessments**

*Built by security professionals, for security professionals*

---

## Why Frameshock?

In the fast-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, penetration testers need tools that are **powerful**, **flexible**, and **scalable**. Frameshock delivers exactly that‚Äîa clean, modular framework that lets you focus on what matters: finding vulnerabilities and securing systems.

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional pentesting tools often force you to:
- Work with bloated frameworks loaded with modules you'll never use
- Manually manage multiple targets and sessions
- Switch between different tools for payload generation and exploitation
- Spend more time wrestling with tools than actually testing

**Frameshock changes that.**

## What Makes Frameshock Different

### üéØ **Shodan Integration for Scale**
Automatically discover and target vulnerable systems at scale. Search, identify, and queue targets directly from Shodan's massive database. Perfect for red team exercises and large-scale assessments.

### üîß **Pick & Drop Modularity**
True modular architecture. Drop your custom exploits into the `Modules/` directory and they're instantly available. No configuration, no registration‚Äîjust pure simplicity.

### üé≠ **Multi-Target, Multi-Session Management**
Built-in multithreading handles multiple victims simultaneously. Stable, secure, and designed for operations beyond the LAN.

### üöÄ **Complete Payload Arsenal**
- Generic reverse shells (sh, bash)
- Python-based reverse connections
- Full Meterpreter integration
- Cross-platform payload support

### üíæ **Intelligent Target Management**
SQLite-backed target database with filtering, categorization, and bulk operations. Never lose track of your scope again.
